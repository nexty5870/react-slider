# Simple React Slider app

Practice make you better, everyday one step closer to your goal!

## Practice exercise

This app take an array of picture from unsplash, use tailwindcss and use React Icons to make the slider from scratch

## Thing I learn during the process

tailwindcss property to change the color of the icons using the fill-current statement

```
className={
                  index === currentSlide
                    ? "text-2xl cursor-pointer fill-current text-[#9CA3AF]"
                    : "text-2xl cursor-pointer fill-current text-[#1E293B]"
                }
```

The above code allow me to change the color of the RxDot icons base on the position of the slide
